**EXPR.jl**

Manipulate and transform Julia expressions like a pro.

**Unlock the Power of Metaprogramming**

EXPR.jl provides a suite of tools to analyze, modify, and generate Julia code at runtime. Build sophisticated macros, extend the language, or create custom domain-specific languages (DSLs) within Julia.

**Features**

* **Introspection:** Inspect code objects, access their components (arguments, body, etc.), and query type information.
* **Transformation:** Construct or modify Julia expressions programmatically. Create functions that dynamically write other functions.
* **Syntax Helpers:** Utilities to streamline the creation of macros and quote manipulation.

**Installation**

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("EXPR")
```

**A Taste of EXPR.jl**

```julia
using EXPR

function make_adder(n)
    quote  # Start a quoted expression
       x -> x + $n
    end
end

add_5 = make_adder(5) 
println(add_5(10))  # Output: 15 
```

**When to Use EXPR.jl**

* **Advanced Macros:** When simple macros aren't enough, EXPR.jl gives you full control.
* **Language Extensions:** Implement custom syntax or features tailored to your domain.
* **Code Generation:** For tasks where writing code to write code is the solution.

**Notes**

* EXPR.jl unlocks powerful metaprogramming techniques. Use responsibly and be mindful of potential performance implications.
* Excellent documentation is essential for a library like this.
